      <h2>Text Manipulation Features</h2>

<h3>1. handleUpClick - Convert Text to Uppercase</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Converts the text entered in the textarea to uppercase.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> When the user clicks the "Convert to Upper" button, the text in the textarea is transformed to uppercase. The updated text is then displayed in the textarea.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> Uppercase conversion might be used when formatting text to meet certain style guidelines, such as titles, headings, or emphasis in documents.</p>

<h3>2. handleLowClick - Convert Text to Lowercase</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Converts the text entered in the textarea to lowercase.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> When the user clicks the "Convert to Lower" button, the text in the textarea is transformed to lowercase. The updated text is then displayed in the textarea.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> Lowercase conversion is useful when ensuring uniformity in text, especially for case-insensitive processing, such as email addresses or certain code snippets.</p>

<h3>3. handleOnChange - Handle Text Input Changes</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Updates the state whenever the user types in the textarea.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> As the user types, the text state is updated with the current value of the textarea.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> Real-time updates allow the application to reflect changes as the user types, enabling instant feedback and interaction with other functions, such as word count or vowel/consonant analysis.</p>

<h3>4. countWords - Count the Number of Words</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Counts the number of words in the entered text.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> It trims the text to remove extra spaces and splits it by spaces to count the words. If the text is empty or contains only spaces, it returns 0.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> Word count is essential in scenarios where text length matters, such as writing essays, articles, social media posts, or when adhering to word limits in forms and applications.</p>

<h3>5. changeTextColor - Change the Color of the Text</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Cycles through different colors for the text in the textarea.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Changes the color of the text each time the "Change Text Color" button is clicked. The color cycles through a predefined sequence (e.g., black → red → green → orange → pink → black).</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> Changing text color can be useful for highlighting, emphasizing certain parts of text, or simply for aesthetic purposes in design tools or text editors.</p>

<h3>6. countVowelsConsonants - Count Vowels and Consonants</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Counts the number of vowels and consonants in the entered text.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Converts the text to lowercase and then iterates through each character to determine if it's a vowel or a consonant. It returns an object containing the counts of vowels and consonants.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> This function can be useful in educational tools for teaching language, phonetics, or in linguistic analysis. It's also helpful in applications that require a deeper understanding of text structure.</p>

<h3>7. clearText - Clear the Text</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Clears all the text from the textarea.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> When the user clicks the "Clear Text" button, the textarea is emptied.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Life Use:</strong> Clearing text is a common feature in text editing applications, allowing users to quickly remove all content and start fresh. It is particularly useful in forms or tools where users may need to reset their input.</p>

<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Disabled Buttons:</strong> All buttons are disabled when the text is empty. This prevents actions that would have no effect or could lead to errors (e.g., trying to change the text color when there is no text).</li>
    <li><strong>Text Summary:</strong> The component provides a summary of the text, including the word count, character count, reading time, and the number of vowels and consonants.</li>
    <li><strong>Preview:</strong> The component shows a preview of the text with the current color applied, allowing users to see the changes in real time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Real-Life Application</h3>
<p>This Textform component could be part of a larger text processing tool or editor where users need to manipulate and analyze text. It's useful in educational contexts, content creation, or anywhere text formatting and analysis are required. The combination of these functions makes the component a versatile tool for working with text in various scenarios.</p>
